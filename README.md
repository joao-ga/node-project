# Flight Management Project

This project was developed for the Projeto Integrador 2 in the second semester of college. The objective of this project is to manage flights, routes, and seat maps using Node.js and OracleDB.

## Description

This project consists of a backend application that allows:
- Editing route information.
- Registering new flights.
- Retrieving seat map references.

The application was developed using TypeScript, Express.js, and the oracledb library to interact with an Oracle database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **oracledb**: Library for connecting and interacting with Oracle Database.
